1.	Tool Selection Justification 
o	Why did you choose this tool?
o	I choose the Cursor because it is well known and easy to use for the making the app. And it works well.

o	What made it appealing for this project?
o	This project can be used by everyone; developer, marketer etc. And easy to use apps with clear UI can attract the everyone.

2.	Development Process 
o	How did you use the tool throughout development?
o	First, I provided Gemini with the requirements and needs for clean code. When the prompt was ready, I gave it to Cursor and waited for the app to finish.

o	What prompts or commands were most effective?
o	Specific codes, like “this line for the changing the color” was more effective than the other ones.

o	How many iterations did it take to get working code?
o	Actually, everything went well until the project was running. At the end of the project, however, there were "npm" and other problems. I tried to handle it three or four times, and it went well.

3.	Challenges and Solutions 
o	What difficulties did you encounter?
o	It is the only difficulties that I encountered was execute the project.

o	How did the AI tool help (or not help) overcome them?
o	When i describe the problem and gives the code of the problem what was written in the terminal Cursor handle it and done it.

o	What did you have to fix or modify manually?
o	I only manually download the “npm” for the execute the project, but this idea also given by Cursor to me.

4.	Reflection 
o	What surprised you about vibe coding?
o	It was quick and didn't create many issues. It was good at making the app.

o	How did it change your development workflow?
o	It rapidly increase the time for the coding the, if someone try to build this it maybe took one day for it but Cursor made it almost thirty minutes with issues.

o	Would you use this tool for future projects? Why or why not?
o	Yes, i will use it because it is better to catching mistakes rather than me and it is so much faster than me.
o	How do you think this technology might impact software development?
o	I think the number of team members on software development teams will decrease because there won't be a need for as many developers on a team. These tools will help developers build apps faster than human developers can.
