Windsurf
Like an cursor, it is an AI-IDE startup founded by Varun Mohan. In 2025, Google transferred Varun to its company, and Windsurf sold it to Cognition AI. It is more similar to VS Code than to Cursor. However, you can use your VS Code settings on both. In Windsurf, you can also use your JetBrains settings.

Replit
Although it is not an IDE like Windsurf or Cursor, you can create apps with prompts. You can also write code in its browser.  You can connect different apps, such as Gmail, GitHub, and Notion.

v0.dev
It was published by the Vercel company and is similar to the Replit online AI development app. Vercel also published the Next.js framework.
You can create apps directly with your prompts, but there is no page for writing code.
There are two different plans for individuals: a free version and a premium version. The free version has a 7-message-per-day limit. You will have $5 of included monthly credits.

Traditional Code Completion

How do they go beyond simple autocomplete?
The Vibe Code platforms and tools focus on the product. Because of this, they try to show different alternatives to the "autocomplete" feature. If you don't ask a specific question, the tools will give you new codes that are different from your own. However, autocomplete tries to correct your code and does not differentiate it.  Also, the use of LLMs or other AI tools by Vibe Code explains why it uses this style.
What additional context do they consider?
They actually focus mostly on your prompt, and then on the folders and documents of the project. If you use online products or apps like Lovable or Bolt and import designs from the Canva tool, it will arrange the codes assigned to your tasks, so the design is important, too.


GitHub Copilot

How is the interaction model different?
Due to its market share and Microsoft’s influence, this tool can reach more people and developers. It also comes with VS Code, a popular IDE, so you can use it whenever you want. Because it is so code-oriented, it is more similar to Windsurf and Cursor than to Lovable, v0, or Bolt.new, which focus on the product.
What additional capabilities do vibe coding tools offer?
Normally, when you write code for your product, you can think about it beforehand, which can take time. It can also change while you are coding, etc. However, with Vibe Coding, the LLM feature can provide ideas for your product and allow you to make changes while the tool codes the product. Also, when you focus on the first page, you might miss some code from the other pages, but the app cannot forget the content, and it protects against misleads.
For example, while Copilot might suggest a function implementation based on the current file, a vibe coding tool could simultaneously consider the database schema, the front-end design, and the deployment configuration. This multi-layered awareness makes vibe coding more suitable for complex, product-driven workflows.
On the downside, vibe coding tools may sometimes generate overly ambitious or unnecessary code, requiring developers to refine or simplify outputs. Copilot, by contrast, tends to be more conservative, sticking closely to the developer’s immediate intent.



ChatGPT/Claude in a separate window

How does integration into the IDE change the workflow?
It can make the product easier to make and speed up the deployment process because it takes time to work on the browser rather than directly on the IDE. You can work in the same window while thinking and coding, which reduces time.
What are the advantages of context-aware, project-integrated AI?
Developers and others can forget the context and make a mistake by focusing on one page rather than the whole project. However, if you import the whole project into one tool, it reads all the pages, documents, and other things, so the chance of missteps and future problems is reduced.
